# bamazon

This repository contains mysql database and node app. The database has the following
* item_id (unique id for each product)
* product_name (Name of product)
* department_name
* price (cost to customer)
* stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)


## Objectives
## The app should prompt user with two messages.
* The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
* The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
